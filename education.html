            <p style="padding-top: 10%;" class="text">It was 2016 when my formal education stated by an admission to Khulna NAVY School. I studied there throught the year. In 2017, I stayed in that institution but not so longer because I was going to take preparation for admission into a better institution. So, within two months I left Navy School and stated studying in a good admission center(Okkhor Biddapith). Throughtout that industrious year, I took part in 4 school admission and Alhamdulillah I won everytime. I decided to study at Khulna Public college(KPC). There I read from class 3 to class 5(2018-2020). Generally, PSC examination were held in the end of class 5. But I missed that withness due to COVID-19 epidemic. In class 5, I get myself touched with Online Class. That's the experience of my primary journey.</p>
